Project 4
CS4760



Compiles with just "make" command as usual

	- "make clean" removes objects and logfile
INVOCATION:
	oss [-h] [-s t] [-l f]	

	-h Describe how the project should be run and then, terminate.
	-s t Indicate how many maximum seconds before the system terminates
	-l f Specify a particular name for the log file


I've spent alot of time trying to debug, but its pretty hard clunky **SLOW** and cumbersome in this
system. The program is segfaulting when it prints to the file so I believe theres an allocation issue. 
Will continue to work on it but i have to turn in somthing.
