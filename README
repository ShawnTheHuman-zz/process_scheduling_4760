Project 4
CS4760



Compiles with just "make" command as usual

	- "make clean" removes objects and logfile
INVOCATION:
	oss [-h] [-s t] [-l f]	

	-h Describe how the project should be run and then, terminate.
	-s t Indicate how many maximum seconds before the system terminates
	-l f Specify a particular name for the log file

Issues:
	This isnt finished but it compiles and calls the child but its failing in
	child program. needs alot more work.
